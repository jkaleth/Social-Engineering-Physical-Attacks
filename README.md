###Social Engineering toolkit in Kali Linux 

SET (Social Engineering Toolkit) is a powerful tool available in Kali Linux designed for penetration testing. Here are five popular commands frequently used within SET:

**setoolkit:** To launch the Social Engineering Toolkit, you can simply type setoolkit in the terminal and hit Enter. This command opens the graphical user interface (GUI) where you can navigate through various options and attacks.

- **Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors:** In SET, you can perform a spear-phishing attack using different techniques such as sending malicious emails. After launching SET, select "1" for "Social-Engineering Attacks," then "2" for "Website Attack Vectors," and finally "3" for "Credential Harvester Attack Method."

- **SMS Spoofing Attack Vectors:** This command allows you to send spoofed SMS messages. Within SET, choose "1" for "Social-Engineering Attacks," then "4" for "Wireless Access Point Attack Vectors," and finally "7" for "SMS Spoofing Attack Vector."

- **Infectious Media Generator:** This option in SET creates infected files for USB drives or other external storage devices. To access it, choose "1" for "Social-Engineering Attacks," then "3" for "Infectious Media Generator."

- **Create a Payload and Listener:** SET enables you to create a payload and set up a listener to capture connections. To do this, select "8" for "Powershell Attack Vectors" or "9" for "Python Attack Vectors" under the "Social-Engineering Attacks" menu.

Remember, it's crucial to use such tools ethically and legally. Misuse of these tools can result in legal consequences. Always ensure you have proper authorization and permission before performing any form of penetration testing or security
